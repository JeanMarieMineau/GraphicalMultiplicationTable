This program uses python3 and pygame.

You need a python3 interpreter (www.python.org) and pygame installed. 
(`python -m pip install pygame` (window), `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` + `sudo pip3 install pygame` (linux))

This program creates a circle of n points. The first point is 1 mod n.  The second point is 2 mod n etc.
Depending on the selected table (for instance x), a line is drawn between the 'a' points and the 'a*x' point.

The examples change the number of points and the tables.
