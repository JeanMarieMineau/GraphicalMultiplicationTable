This program uses python3 and pygame.

You need a python3 interpreter (www.python.org) and pygame installer. 
(`python -m pip install pygame` (window), `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` + `sudo pip3 install pygame` (linux))

This program creates a circle of n points. The first point is 1 modulo n.  The second  point is 2 modulo n ...
Depending on the selected table (for exemple x), a line is drawn between the a points and the a*x point.

The exemples change the number of points and the tables.
